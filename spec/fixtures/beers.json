Sweet, malty aroma with a satisfying balance of hoppiness. Tremendously intriguing, complex flavors play upon the palate shifting from sweet to tangy to hoppy and so on. The medium-dryfinish leaves you eager for the next sip.","abv":10.5,"created_at":"2011-05-29T03:25:05Z","updated_at":"2011-05-29T03:25:05Z","brewery":{"id":7,"name":"AleSmith"}},{"id":50,"name":"Horny Devil","description":"An authentic Belgian Style ale, from the Belgian candi sugar right down to the yeast, a Belgian strain from a Trappist monastery in Belgium. In addition to the malts, candi sugar and fresh hops, there is also a little added twist from coriander seeds, which impart a refreshing citrus flavor to an outstanding ale. Bright straw/light yellow color and good head formation and retention when properly served. Appealing Brussels lace. Intriguingly complex.","abv":11,"created_at":"2011-05-29T03:25:05Z","updated_at":"2011-05-29T03:25:05Z","brewery":{"id":7,"name":"AleSmith"}}]}
